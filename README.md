# SureStart 2021 VAIL Program

## Responses

Day 1 (02/08/2021): During this program, I hope to gain a stronger understanding of various topics within AI and discover how they can be applied to solve challenging real-world problems. Through the daily curriculum, I aim to learn new technical skills that are needed for machine learning projects and create technology that can reflect human emotions. I hope that I can then apply my new knowledge during the Makeathon phase and learn valuable teamwork skills by working closely with my team and mentor. I am also looking forward to attending the various talks and seminars to get advice on how to have a successful career in this field!

Day 2 (02/09/2021): 
1. Supervised learning is the machine learning task where the program is trained on a pre-defined set of training examples. The main goal is usually to develop a finely tuned predictor function, and the two major subcategories are regression and classification. On the other hand, with unsupervised learning, there are no training examples used. Instead, the program must find hidden patterns and relationships within unlabeled data.
2. The statement, "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries", is FALSE because Scikit-Learn is built on top of these common Python libraries. While Scikit-Learn focuses on the data modelling, these libraries are needed for the extra steps of loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.
