# SureStart 2021 VAIL Program

## Responses

#### Day 1 (February 8, 2021):
During this program, I hope to gain a stronger understanding of various topics within AI and discover how they can be applied to solve challenging real-world problems. Through the daily curriculum, I aim to learn new technical skills that are needed for machine learning projects and create technology that can reflect human emotions. I hope that I can then apply my new knowledge during the Makeathon phase and learn valuable teamwork skills by working closely with my team and mentor. I am also looking forward to attending the various talks and seminars to get advice on how to have a successful career in this field!

#### Day 2 (February 9, 2021): 
1. Supervised learning is the machine learning task where the program is trained on a pre-defined set of training examples. The main goal is usually to develop a finely tuned predictor function, and the two major subcategories are regression and classification. On the other hand, with unsupervised learning, there are no training examples used. Instead, the program must find hidden patterns and relationships within unlabeled data.
2. The statement, "Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries", is FALSE because Scikit-Learn is built on top of these common Python libraries. While Scikit-Learn focuses on the data modelling, these libraries are needed for the extra steps of loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data.

#### Day 3 (February 10, 2021):
1. Tensors are implemented in TensorFlow as multidimensional data arrays. They are the mathematical representation of physical entities with both magnitude and multiple directions, so they generalize scalars, vectors and matrices to higher dimensions. In an example of a tensor being represented by an array of 2R numbers in a 3-dimensional space, the "R" represents the rank of the tensor and the tensor will require N^R numbers in an N-dimensional space. Therefore, in a 3-dimensional space, a second-rank tensor can be represented by 3^2 (9) numbers. Tensors are used in machine learning to encode multi-dimensional data, as well as for the training and operation of deep learning models.
2. While working on the tutorial, what I noticed about computations ran in the TensorFlow programs is that the result doesn't actually get calculated. In order to actually calculate and see the result, it is necessary to run the code in an interactive Session.

#### Day 4 (February 11, 2021):
Today I learned about the difference between deep learning and machine learning, as well as how deep learning can be applied to various real-world problems. I also gained a better understanding of how artificial neural networks work and the different types of neural networks that exist. I then read the short additional article about ethics in machine learning, in which the main idea was that the three main possible avenues for "cheating" lie in the data, algorithm, and results. I believe it will be essential to constantly keep these ethical concerns in mind while working on future projects to ensure that ML systems maintain their integrity and are truly bringing about good change.

A real-world problem that could potentially be solved using deep learning is early detection of COVID-19 (and other infectious diseases). The dataset that I found for this specific problem is: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8h65ywd2jr/3. This dataset contains over 17,000 X-Ray and CT Chest images from both Non-COVID and COVID cases. Using this data, the deep learning algorithm that I would likely use to develop a solution is a Convolutional Neural Network. I believe that a CNN would be the best approach because they are a powerful way to learn useful representations of images and are scalable for large datasets. In addition, since CNNs are already considered the leading model for image recognition tasks, it would likely result in a higher accuracy.

#### Day 5 (February 12, 2021):
Using what I learned from the Keras Tutorial and Deep Learning Guide, I worked on developing a NN model with the News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection. The .ipynb file from my Kaggle Notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/angiechoi/sarcasm-detection).
