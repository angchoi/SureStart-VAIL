# SureStart 2021 VAIL Program

## Responses

Day 1 (02/08/2021): During this program, I hope to gain a stronger understanding of various topics within AI and discover how they can be applied to solve challenging real-world problems. Through the daily curriculum, I aim to learn new technical skills that are needed for machine learning projects and create technology that can reflect human emotions. I hope that I can then apply my new knowledge during the Makeathon phase and learn valuable teamwork skills by working closely with my team and mentor. I am also looking forward to attending the various talks and seminars to get advice on how to have a successful career in this field!
